# Bionify
A replication of Bionic Reader from [ycombinator by hexomancer](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30787290#30788949) but as a temper monkey script

## How to install

1. install [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo)
2. open [this](https://github.com/BuyMyMojo/Bionify/raw/main/Bionify.user.js) link to install to tamper monkey
3. enable on any page you want through the extension

### License
Hexomancer was the one to write it origionally so unless they otherwise object I'm just having it as MIT license since it's so simple, like the code <3

#### Other tools

You should go check out the [fastread](https://github.com/ahrm/chrome-fastread) extension for chrome if you use it, it's the one I personally use.
